Exercice 01_cardGenerator : </br>
I started by importing random and sys. 
Then I suggest if we want to generate a visa or a mastercard. 
I created a function that will generate 16 digits. 
With an “if” and “elif” we indicate that the visa starts with a 4 and Mastercard a 5.
If neither, we “print” an error.  
The "sys.exit" stops the error. We finally use luhn's algorithm to verify the card.

Exercice 02_passwordGenerator : </br>
We start by importing "string and random". 
We suggest the length of the password. 
The password is randomly mixed and generated.

Exercice 03_pinCode : </br>
First we import "hashlib" to hash the future password. 
We define the search frame between 72000000 and 99999999.
We hashes all the passwords that we are going to generate. 
Once the password is found, it is indicated.
